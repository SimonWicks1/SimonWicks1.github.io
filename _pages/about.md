Hi everyone, welcome to my personal website. I am currently a second-year M.Phil. student in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). 

My research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning and decision-making in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. I have worked extensively on developing safe decision-making algorithms for autonomous vehicles, particularly in high-dynamic environments, accounting for the behavior of human drivers. I also attended the EPFL-ETHZ MARL Summer School this year, where I deepened my understanding of multi-agent collaboration and game theory in the context of autonomous driving. In addition to technical research, I am highly interested in the potential of combining large language models (LLMs) with robotic systems, especially in enhancing semantic understanding and decision-making in real-world environments. My recent work involves leveraging semantic information to guide agents in navigation and exploration, while using reinforcement learning to improve the robustness and efficiency of decision-making algorithms. 

<b>I am currently seeking PhD opportunities that align with my research interests, with the goal of continuing my studies and making meaningful contributions to the field.</b>
