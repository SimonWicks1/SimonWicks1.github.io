Hello everyone, welcome to my personal website. I am currently a second-year PhD student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). My main research areas include multi-sensor fusion SLAM, computer vision, and the application of emerging technologies in autonomous driving and robotics. I am a practice-oriented individual, focusing on the engineering implementation of algorithms. I often use different technology stacks for various application scenarios and have extensive experience in implementing important projects. I welcome friends with similar interests to connect and exchange ideas!
