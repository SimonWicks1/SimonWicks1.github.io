Test 6
Hi, welcome to my personal website! I am currently a second-year M.Phil. student in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) under the supervision of <a href="https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/junma/people-page.html">Prof. Jun MA</a>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronic and Information Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). 

<b>I am currently seeking PhD opportunities that align with my research interests in 2025, with the goal of continuing my studies and making meaningful contributions to the field.</b>

Research Interests
===
* Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
* Multi-Agent Collaboration and Game
* Decision-Making in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments
* Safe Decision-Making Algorithms for Autonomous Vehicles
* Large Language Models (LLMs) for Robotic Systems
  
My research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning and decision-making in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. In addition to technical research, I am highly interested in the potential of combining large language models (LLMs) with robotic systems, especially in enhancing semantic understanding and decision-making in real-world environments. My recent work involves leveraging semantic information to guide agents in navigation and exploration, while using reinforcement learning to improve the robustness and efficiency of decision-making algorithms.
