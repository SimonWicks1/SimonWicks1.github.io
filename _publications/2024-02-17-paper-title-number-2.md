## Abstract
At present, in the large-scale book management
scene, book sorting, daily maintenance and book retrieval are very
common, but the book information is complicated and the
efficiency of relying on manual management is extremely poor.
Although there have been many self-service book systems based on
optics or vision, they are mostly based on traditional computer
vision algorithms such as boundary extraction. Due to the fact that
there are more artificial experience thresholds, some shortcomings
such as low detection accuracy, poor robustness, and inability to
systematically deploy on a large scale, which lack of insufficient
intelligence. Therefore, we proposed a book information
extraction algorithm based on object detection and optical
character recognition (OCR) that is suitable for multiple book
information recognition, multiple book image angles and multiple
book postures. It can be applied to scenes such as book sorting,
bookshelf management and book retrieval. The system we
designed includes the classification of book covers and back covers,
the classification of books upright and inverted, the detection of
book pages side and spine side, the recognition of book pricing. In
terms of accuracy, the classification accuracy of the front cover
and the back cover is 99.9%, the upright classification accuracy of
book front covers is 98.8%, the back cover reaches 99.9%, the
accuracy of book price recognition get 94.5%, and the book
spine/page side detection mAP reaches 99.6%; in terms of
detection speed, Yolov5 detection model was improved and the
statistical-based pre-pruning strategy was adopted, support by our
algorithm the system reaches 2.09 FPS in book price recognition,
which improves the detection speed to meet actual needs.
